Device-Tree Bindings for a PPS generated signal on GPIO

These properties describe a PPS (pulse-per-second) signal output 
through a GPIO pin.

Required properties:
- pps-gen-gpios: one PPS GPIO in the format described by ../gpio/gpio.txt

Optional properties:
- assert-falling-edge: when present, assert is indicated by a falling edge
                       (instead of by a rising edge)

Example:
	pps-gen {
		compatible = "pps-generator-gpios";
		pps-gen-gpios = <&gpio2 6 0>;

		assert-falling-edge;
	};
