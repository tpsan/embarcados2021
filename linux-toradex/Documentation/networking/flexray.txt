1 Overview / What is Socket FlexRay
-----------------------------------

The socket FlexRay package is an implementation of FlexRay protocols
for Linux. FlexRay is a networking technology used in automotive fields as
successor of the Controller Area Network (CAN). It is designed to be faster
and more reliable than CAN.
The Socket FlexRay implementation uses the Berkeley socket API, the Linux
network stack and implements the FlexRay device drivers as network interfaces.
The FlexRay socket API has been designed as similar as possible to the TCP/IP
protocols to allow programmers, familiar with network programming, to easily
learn how to use FlexRay sockets.
